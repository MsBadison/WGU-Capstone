This project was part of the capstone for my Computer Science degree at WGU. 

The goal was to identify a business need at an organization that I could solve by machine learning, design the implementation, and then implement it. 

I chose a fictional hospital that was trying to identify the risk of sepsis patients. 

I trained a machine learning model on the Sepsis Survival Prediction dataset from Kaggle. My model was able to predict, with 92% accuracy, a sepsis patient's chance of survival, given biographical information about the patient, such as age, sex, and number of sepsis infections. 

I wrote the application in Python and implemented the machine learning aspect with Keras and TensorFlow. I hosted it on Google Colab.

To run the application:

    1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/github/MsBadison/WGU-Capstone/blob/main/Sepsis.ipynb
    2. Select Runtime > Run all
    3. If there is a warning, click Run anyway
    4. Once the application has finished loading, enter the patient data and click Calculate
