This project was part of the capstone for my Computer Science degree at WGU. 

The goal was to identifiy a business need at an organisation that could be solved by machine learning, design the implementation, then implement it. 

I chose a ficitonal hospital that was trying to idnetifiy the risk of sepsis patients. 

I trained a machine learning model on the Sepsis Survival Prediction dataset from Kaggle. My model was able to predict, with 92% accuracy, whether a sepsis patient would survive or not, given biographical information about the patient such as age, sex, and number of sepsis infections. 

The project was written in Python, and the machine learning aspect was implemented with Keras and Tensorflow.
